core each Workshop
    02 -> data understanding with tools for easy to summary data, model (selaction, save, load), pipeline
    03 -> create pipeline for deal with mixed data type
    04 -> select threshold for make that class more important with ROC curve
    05 -> transform time series data into cyclic for easy to make condition when want to explain time series dataset
    06 -> how to get target from raw data
    07 -> basic pytorch auto_grad, training model
    08 -> data loader and transform data
    09 -> data loader with images dataset and transfer learning
    10 -> object detection single and multiple object
    11 -> segment with masking method
    12 -> dataset and data loader (labular, images)
    13 -> model training with data loader
    14 -> object detection with yolov10 and analize point of obunding box
    15 -> object detection with yolo-seg and analize problem result
